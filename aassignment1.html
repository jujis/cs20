<h1>About me </h1>
<p>My name is Juliana Alscher</p>
<p>My major is data science but I am also minoring in finance</p>
<p>My IP address is: 73.159.114.70 </p>
<p>I grew up in many places, my dad is German and my mom is Colombian so I was always moving around. I was born in Mexico City, Mexico, but moved to Germany when I was 10, then to Costa Rica when I was 12, and then to Atlanta when I was 15. I now live in here in Somerville. </p>
<p> Something no one would expect from me is that I can lick my elbow </p>

<p> My favorite place is this beach which is a place I go to everytime I go back to Costa Rica with my family </p>
